# Rubber Ducking
You can ignore everything here to be honest. I'm just going to be rambling on about a bunch of stuff that I want to do and how I'll probably do them. You know, if I actually stick to my word and make them.

## CSV to JSON conversion
I don't think I'll actually go through with this but give me a minute. Since we're testing everything using returned JSON files, the current CSVs on DigitalOcean don't work and can be used as test subjects. Now, this could easily be done with python. I think. Actually, gimme one minute.
